# Data Model of Fragile States
This project developed an exploratory data analysis report.
The report contain data from several countries from the year 2015 to 2020.
It contains an interactive heat map, a country dashboard and a comparative analysis between countries.
The Fragile States Index is based on a conflict assessment framework – known as “CAST” – that was developed by FFP nearly a quarter-century ago for assessing the vulnerability of states to collapse.
